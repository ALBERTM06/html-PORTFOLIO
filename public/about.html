<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m an 18-year-old Computer Science student based in Nairobi, Kenya, 
  with a growing passion for technology, space exploration, and purpose-driven innovation. 
  I'm currently exploring how software, satellite data, and machine learning can solve real-world problems—
  especially in Africa. I’m also building my communication and leadership skills, inspired by my Christian faith
  , which grounds my vision to create meaningful impact. Whether I’m coding, learning, 
  or leading small projects, I strive to grow with intention, serve others, and pursue excellence.</p>
